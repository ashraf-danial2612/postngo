# postngo
Post 'n Go is a web-based system that helps users overcome time constraints during the posting process, which manages the customer’s information from the physical to an online process. The system will help users meet the requirements and solve user problems. With the features that we provide, such as online form, QR Code feature, tracking the user items, and outlet finder will smooth the post-process without having any difficulty for the user. Therefore, this system also will implement SDG goals number 15, which are ‘life on land’ by reducing the usage of the paper, transforming the system into an ecosystem, and increasing profitability.
